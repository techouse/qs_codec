"""Utilities for decoding percent‑encoded query strings and splitting composite keys into bracketed path segments.

This mirrors the semantics of the Node `qs` library:

- Decoding handles both UTF‑8 and Latin‑1 code paths.
- Key splitting keeps bracket groups *balanced* and optionally treats dots as path separators when ``allow_dots=True``.
- Top‑level dot splitting uses a character‑scanner that handles degenerate cases (leading '.' starts a bracket segment; '.[' is skipped; double dots preserve the first; trailing '.' is preserved) and never treats literal percent‑encoded sequences (e.g., '%2E') as split points; only actual '.' characters at depth 0 are split.

        Notes
        -----
        - In the normal decode path, the key has already been percent-decoded by the upstream
          scanner, so sequences like ``%2E``/``%2e`` are already literal ``.`` when this function
          runs. As a result, with ``allow_dots=True``, any top-level ``.`` will be treated as a
          separator here. This is independent of ``decode_dot_in_keys`` (which only affects how
          encoded dots *inside bracket segments* are normalized later during object folding).
        - If a custom decoder returns raw tokens (i.e., bypasses percent-decoding), ``%2E``/``%2e``
          may still appear here; those percent sequences are preserved verbatim and are **not**
          used as separators.

        Rules
        -----
        - Only dots at depth == 0 split. Dots inside ``[]`` are preserved.
        - Degenerate cases:
          * leading ``.`` starts a bracket segment (``.a`` behaves like ``[a]``)
          * ``.[`` is skipped so ``a.[b]`` behaves like ``a[b]``
          * ``a..b`` preserves the first dot → ``a.[b]``
          * trailing ``.`` is preserved and ignored by the splitter

        Examples
        --------
        'user.email.name' -> 'user[email][name]'
        'a[b].c' -> 'a[b][c]'
        'a[.].c' -> 'a[.][c]'
        'a%2E[b]' -> 'a%2E[b]' (only if a custom decoder left it encoded)
