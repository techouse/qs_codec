"""Decoding context used by the query string parser and utilities.

This enum indicates whether a given piece of text is being decoded as a *key*
(or key segment) or as a *value*. The distinction matters for encoded dots
(``%2E``/``%2e``) in keys: when decoding keys, the default behavior is to
*preserve* these so that higherâ€‘level options like ``allow_dots`` and
``decode_dot_in_keys`` can be applied consistently later in the parse.

    ----------
    KEY
        Decode a *key* (or key segment). Note that the default scalar decoder
        (``qs_codec.utils.decode_utils.decode``) ignores `kind` and fully
        decodes percent-encoded dots (``%2E``/``%2e``). Dot-splitting behavior is
        applied later by higher-level parser options.
    VALUE
        Decode a *value*. Implementations typically perform full percent decoding.
